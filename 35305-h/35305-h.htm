<h3>"PREFATORY NOTE"</h3>

<p><i>The concluding piece, "Pill-Doctor Herdal," is, as the observant reader
will instantly perceive, rather a reverent attempt to tread in the
footprints of the Norwegian dramatist, than a version of any actually
existing masterpiece. The author is conscious that his imitation is
painfully lacking in the mysterious obscurity of the original, that the
vein of allegorical symbolism is thinner throughout than it should be,
and that the characters are not nearly so mad as persons invariably are
in real life&mdash;but these are the faults inevitable to a prentice hand,
and he trusts that due allowances may be made for them by the critical.</i></p>

<p><i>In conclusion he wishes to express his acknowledgments to Messrs.
Bradbury and Agnew for their permission to reprint the present volume,
the contents of which made their original appearance in the pages of
"Punch"</i></p>

<h3>ACT FIRST</h3>

<p class="hangindent"><i>Sitting-room at Rosmershölm, with a stove, flower-stand, windows,
ancient and modern ancestors, doors, and everything handsome about it.</i>
<span class="smcap">Rebecca West</span> <i>is sitting knitting a large antimacassar which is nearly
finished. Now and then she looks out of a window, and smiles and nods
expectantly to someone outside.</i> <span class="smcap">Madam Helseth</span> <i>is laying the table for
supper.</i></p>

<center><span class="smcap">Rebecca.</span></center>

<p>[<i>Folding up her work slowly.</i>] But tell me precisely,
what about this white horse?</p>

<p class="direction">[<i>Smiling quietly.</i></p>

<center><span class="smcap">Madam Helseth.</span></center>

<p>Lord forgive you, Miss!&mdash;[<i>fetching cruet-stand, and placing it on
table</i>]&mdash;but you're making fun of me!</p>

<center><span class="smcap">Rebecca.</span></center>

<p>[<i>Gravely.</i>] No, indeed. Nobody makes fun at Rosmershölm. Mr. Rosmer
would not understand it. [<i>Shutting window.</i>] Ah, here is Rector Kroll.
[<i>Opening door.</i>] You will stay to supper, will you not, Rector, and I
will tell them to give us some little extra dish.</p>

<center><span class="smcap">Kroll.</span></center>

<p>[<i>Hanging up his hat in the hall.</i>] Many thanks. [<i>Wipes his boots.</i>]
May I come in? [<i>Comes in, puts down his stick, sits down, and looks
about him.</i>] And how do you and Rosmer get on together, eh?</p>

<center><span class="smcap">Rebecca.</span></center>

<p>Ever since your sister, Beata, went mad and jumped into the mill-race,
we have been as happy as two little birds together. [<i>After a pause,
sitting down in arm-chair.</i>] So you don't really mind my living here all
alone with Rosmer? We were afraid you might, perhaps.</p>

<center><span class="smcap">Kroll.</span></center>

<p>Why, how on earth&mdash;on the contrary, I shouldn't object at all if
you&mdash;[<i>looks at her meaningly</i>]&mdash;h'm!</p>

<center><span class="smcap">Rebecca.</span></center>

<p>[<i>Interrupting, gravely.</i>] For shame, Rector; how can you make such
jokes?</p>

<center><span class="smcap">Kroll.</span></center>

<p>[<i>As if surprised.</i>] Jokes! We do not joke in these parts&mdash;but here is
Rosmer.</p>

<p class="direction">[<i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Rosmer</span>, <i>gently and softly.</i>
</p>

<center><span class="smcap">Rosmer</span>.</center>

<p>So, my dear old friend, you have come again, after a year's absence.
[<i>Sits down.</i>] We almost thought that&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<center><span class="smcap">Kroll.</span></center>

<p>[<i>Nods.</i>] So Miss West was saying&mdash;but you are quite mistaken. I merely
thought I might remind you, if I came, of our poor Beata's suicide, so I
kept away. We Norwegians are not without our simple tact.</p>

<center><span class="smcap">Rosmer</span>.</center>

<p>It was considerate&mdash;but unnecessary. Reb&mdash;I <i>mean</i>, Miss West&mdash;and I
often allude to the incident, do we not?</p>

<center><span class="smcap">Rebecca.</span></center>

<p>[<i>Strikes Tändstickor.</i>] Oh yes, indeed. [<i>Lighting lamp.</i>] Whenever we
feel a little more cheerful than usual.</p>

<center><span class="smcap">Kroll.</span></center>

<p>You dear good people! [<i>Wanders up the room.</i>] I came because the Spirit
of Revolt has crept into my School. A Secret Society has existed for
weeks in the Lower Third! To-day it has come to my knowledge that a
booby trap was prepared for me by the hand of my own son, Laurits, and
I then discovered that a hair had been inserted in my cane by my
daughter Hilda! The only way in which a right-minded Schoolmaster can
combat this anarchic and subversive spirit is to start a newspaper, and
I thought that you, as a weak, credulous, inexperienced and
impressionable kind of man, were the very person to be the Editor.</p>

<p class="direction">[<span class="smcap">Rebecca</span> <i>laughs softly, as if to herself.</i><br />

<span class="smcap">Rosmer</span> <i>jumps up and sits down again.</i></p>

<center><span class="smcap">Rebecca.</span></center>

<p>[<i>With a look at Rosmer.</i>] Tell him now!</p>

<center><span class="smcap">Rosmer</span>.</center>

<p>[<i>Returning the look.</i>] I can't&mdash;Some other evening. Well, perhaps&mdash;&mdash;
[<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Kroll</span>.] I can't be your Editor&mdash;because [<i>in a low voice</i>] I&mdash;I am
on the side of Laurits and Hilda!</p>

<center><span class="smcap">Kroll.</span></center>

<p>[<i>Looks from one to the other, gloomily.</i>] H'm!</p>

<center><span class="smcap">Rosmer</span>.</center>

<p>Yes. Since we last met, I have changed my views. I am going to create a
new democracy, and awaken it to its true task of making all the people
of this country noblemen, by freeing their wills, and purifying their
minds!</p>

<center><span class="smcap">Kroll.</span></center>

<p>What <i>do</i> you mean!</p>

<p class="direction">[<i>Takes up his hat.</i></p>

<center><span class="smcap">Rosmer</span>.</center>

<p>[<i>Bowing his head.</i>] I don't quite know, my dear friend; it was Reb&mdash;&mdash;
I should say Miss West's scheme.</p>

<center><span class="smcap">Kroll.</span></center>

<p>H'm! [<i>A suspicion appears in his face.</i>] Now I begin to believe that
what Beata said about schemes&mdash;&mdash; no matter. But under the
circumstances, I will <i>not</i> stay to supper.</p>

<p class="direction">[<i>Takes up his stick, and walks out.</i></p>

<center><span class="smcap">Rosmer.</span></center>

<p>I <i>told</i> you he would be annoyed. I shall go to bed now. I don't want
any supper. [<i>He lights a candle, and goes out; presently his footsteps
are heard overhead, as he undresses</i>. <span class="smcap">Rebecca</span> <i>pulls a bell-rope.</i></p>

<center><span class="smcap">Rebecca.</span></center>

<p>[<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Madam Helseth</span>, <i>who enters with dishes.</i>] No, Mr. Rosmer will not
have supper to-night. [<i>In a lighter tone.</i>] Perhaps he is afraid of the
nightmare. There are so many sorts of White Horses in this world!</p>

<center><span class="smcap">Madam Helseth.</span></center>

<p>[<i>Shaking.</i>] Lord! lord! that Miss West&mdash;the things she does say!</p>

<p class="direction">[<span class="smcap">Rebecca</span> <i>goes out through door, knitting antimacassar thoughtfully, as
Curtain falls.</i></p>

<h3><a name="ACT_SECOND" id="ACT_SECOND"></a>ACT SECOND</h3>

<p class="hangindent"><span class="smcap">Rosmer's</span> <i>study. Doors and windows, bookshelves, a writing-table. Door,
with curtain, leading to</i> <span class="smcap">Rosmer's</span> <i>bedroom.</i> <span class="smcap">Rosmer</span> <i>discovered in a
smoking jacket cutting a pamphlet with a paper-knife. There is a knock
at the door.</i> <span class="smcap">Rosmer</span> <i>says "Come in."</i> <span class="smcap">Rebecca</span> <i>enters in a morning
wrapper and curl-papers. She sits on a chair close to</i> <span class="smcap">Rosmer</span>, <i>and
looks over his shoulder as he cuts the leaves.</i> <span class="smcap">Rector Kroll</span> <i>is shown
up.</i></p>

<center><span class="smcap">Kroll.</span></center>

<p>[<i>Lays his hat on the table and looks at</i> <span class="smcap">Rebecca</span> <i>from head to foot.</i>]
I am really afraid that I am in the way.</p>

<center><span class="smcap">Rebecca.</span></center>

<p>[<i>Surprised.</i>] Because I am in my morning wrapper and curl-papers? You
forget that I am <i>emancipated</i>, Rector Kroll.</p>

<p class="direction">[<i>She leaves them and listens behind curtain in</i> <span class="smcap">Rosmer's</span> <i>bedroom</i>.</p>

<center><span class="smcap">Rosmer.</span></center>

<p>Yes, Miss West and I have worked our way forward in faithful
comradeship.</p>

<center><span class="smcap">Kroll.</span></center>

<p>[<i>Shakes his head at him slowly.</i>] So I perceive. Miss West is naturally
inclined to be forward. But, I say, <i>really</i> you know&mdash;&mdash; However, I
came to tell you that poor Beata was not so mad as she looked, though
flowers <i>did</i> bewilder her so. [<i>Taking off his gloves meaningly.</i>] She
jumped into the mill-race because she had an idea that you ought to
marry Miss West!</p>

<h3>"Taking off his gloves meaningly."</h3>
</div>

<center><span class="smcap">Rosmer.</span></center>

<p>[<i>Jumps half up from his chair.</i>] I? Marry&mdash;Miss West! My good gracious,
Kroll! I don't <i>understand</i>, it is <i>most</i> incomprehensible. [<i>Looks
fixedly before him.</i>] How <i>can</i> people?&mdash;&mdash; [<i>Looks at him for a moment,
then rises.</i>] Will you get out? [<i>Still quiet and self-restrained.</i>] But
first tell me why you never mentioned this before?</p>

<center><span class="smcap">Kroll.</span></center>

<p>Why? Because I thought you were both orthodox, which made all the
difference. Now I know that you side with Laurits and Hilda, and mean to
make the democracy into noblemen, and accordingly I intend to make it
hot for you in my paper. <i>Good</i> morning!</p>

<p class="direction">[<i>He slams the door with spite as</i> <span class="smcap">Rebecca</span> <i>enters from bedroom.</i></p>

<center><span class="smcap">Rosmer.</span></center>

<p>[<i>As if surprised.</i>.] You&mdash;in my bedroom! You have been listening, dear?
But you <i>are</i> so emancipated.

Ah, well! so our pure and beautiful friendship has been misinterpreted,
bespattered! Just because you wear a morning wrapper, and have lived
here alone for a year, people with coarse souls and ignoble eyes make
unpleasant remarks! But what really <i>did</i> drive Beata mad? <i>Why</i> did she
jump into the mill-race? I'm sure we did everything we could to spare
her! I made it the business of my life to keep her in ignorance of all
our interests&mdash;<i>didn't</i> I, now?</p>

<center><span class="smcap">Rebecca.</span></center>

<p>You did. But why brood over it? What <i>does</i> it matter? Get on with your
great beautiful task, dear&mdash;[<i>approaching him cautiously from
behind</i>]&mdash;winning over minds and wills, and creating noblemen, you
know&mdash;<i>joyful</i> noblemen!</p>

<center><span class="smcap">Rosmer.</span></center>

<p>[<i>Walking about restlessly, as if in thought.</i>] Yes, I know. I have
never laughed in the whole course of my life&mdash;we Rosmers don't&mdash;and so I
felt that spreading gladness and light, and making the democracy
joyful, was properly my mission. But <i>now</i>&mdash;I feel too upset to go on,
Rebecca, unless&mdash;&mdash; [<i>Shakes his head heavily.</i>] Yes, an idea has just
occurred to me&mdash;&mdash; [<i>Looks at her, and then runs his hands through his
hair</i>]&mdash;Oh, my goodness! No&mdash;I <i>can't</i>.</p>

<p class="direction">[<i>He leans his elbows on table.</i></p>

<center><span class="smcap">Rebecca.</span></center>

<p>Be a free man to the full, Rosmer&mdash;tell me your idea.</p>

<center><span class="smcap">Rosmer.</span></center>

<p>[<i>Gloomily.</i>] I don't know what you'll say to it. It's this: Our
platonic comradeship was all very well while I was peaceful and happy.
Now that I am bothered and badgered, I feel&mdash;<i>why</i>, I can't exactly
explain, but I <i>do</i> feel that I must oppose a new and living reality to
the gnawing memories of the past. I should perhaps, explain that this is
equivalent to an Ibsenian proposal.</p>

<center><span class="smcap">Rebecca.</span></center>

<p>[<i>Catches at the chair-back with joy.</i>] How? at <i>last</i>&mdash;a rise at last!
[<i>Recollects herself.</i>] But what am I about? Am I not an emancipated
enigma? [<i>Puts her hands over her ears as if in terror.</i>] What are you
saying? You mustn't. I can't <i>think</i> what you mean. Go away, do!</p>

<center><span class="smcap">Rosmer</span>.</center>

<p>[<i>Softly.</i>] Be the new and living reality. It is the only way to put
Beata out of the Saga. Shall we try it?</p>

<center><span class="smcap">Rebecca.</span></center>

<p>Never! Do not&mdash;<i>do</i> not ask me why&mdash;for I haven't a notion&mdash;but never!
[<i>Nods slowly to him and rises.</i>] White Horses would not induce me!
[<i>With her hand on door-handle.</i>] Now you <i>know</i>!</p>

<p class="direction">[<i>She goes out.</i></p>

<center><span class="smcap">Rosmer</span>.</center>

<p>[<i>Sits up, stares, thunderstruck, at the stove, and says to himself.</i>]
Well&mdash;I&mdash;<i>am</i>&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Good morning, dear. [<i>A moment after</i>&mdash;<i>crocheting.</i>] Have you seen
Rector Kroll's paper this morning? There's something about <i>you</i> in it.</p>

<center><span class="smcap">Rosmer</span>.</center>

<p>Oh, indeed? [<i>Puts down hat and stick, and takes up paper.</i>] H'm!
[<i>Reads</i>&mdash;<i>then walks about the room.</i>] Kroll <i>has</i> made it hot for me.
[<i>Reads some more.</i>] Oh, this is <i>too</i> bad! Rebecca, they <i>do</i> say such
nasty spiteful things! they actually call me a renegade&mdash;and I can't
<i>think</i> why! They <i>mustn't</i> go on like this. All that is good in human
nature will go to ruin if they're allowed to attack an excellent man
like me! Only think, if I can make them see how unkind they have been!</p>

<center><span class="smcap">Rebecca.</span></center>

<p>Yes, dear, in that you have a great and glorious object to attain&mdash;and I
wish you may get it!</p>

<center><span class="smcap">Rosmer</span>.</center>

<p>Thanks. I think I shall. [<i>Happens to look through window and jumps.</i>]
Ah, no, I shan't&mdash;never now, I have just seen&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>No&mdash;the mill-race, where Beata&mdash;&mdash; [<i>Puts on his hat</i>&mdash;<i>takes it off
again.</i>] I'm beginning to be haunted by&mdash;no, I <i>don't</i> mean the
Horse&mdash;by a terrible suspicion that Beata may have been right after all!
Yes, I do believe, now I come to think of it, that I must really have
been in love with you from the first. Tell me <i>your</i> opinion.</p>

<center><span class="smcap">Rebecca.</span></center>

<p>[<i>Struggling with herself, and still crocheting.</i>] Oh&mdash;I can't exactly
say&mdash;such an odd question to ask me!</p>

<center><span class="smcap">Rosmer</span>.</center>

<p>[<i>Shakes his head.</i>] Perhaps; I have no sense of humour&mdash;no respectable
Norwegian <i>has</i>&mdash;and I <i>do</i> want to know&mdash;because, you see, if I <i>was</i>

that&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>I merely called for the purpose of informing you that I consider you an
artful and designing person, but that, on the whole, considering your
birth and moral antecedents, you know&mdash;[<i>nods at her</i>]&mdash;it is not
surprising. [<span class="smcap">Rebecca</span> <i>walks about wringing her hands.</i>] Why, what <i>is</i>

<p>[<i>Breaking out.</i>] I <i>do</i> mind. I am an emancipated enigma, but I retain
a few little prejudices still. I <i>don't</i> like owning to my real age, and
I <i>do</i> prefer to be legitimate. And, after your information&mdash;of which I
was quite ignorant, as my mother, the late Mrs. Gamvik, never <i>once</i>
alluded to it&mdash;I feel I must confess everything. Strong-minded advanced
women are like that. Here is Rosmer. [<span class="smcap">Rosmer</span> <i>enters with his hat and
stick.</i>] Rosmer, I want to tell you and Rector Kroll a little story. Let
us sit down, dear, all three of us. [<i>They sit down, mechanically, on
chairs.</i>] A long time ago, before the play began&mdash;[<i>in a voice scarcely

<p>Don't be alarmed, dear, it is all over now. After living alone with you
in solitude, when you showed me all your thoughts without
reserve&mdash;little by little, somehow the fancy passed off. I caught the
Rosmer view of life badly, and dulness descended on my soul as an
extinguisher upon one of our Northern dips. The Rosmer view of life is
ennobling, very&mdash;but hardly lively. And I've more yet to tell you.</p>

<i>that</i>! Never mind the Past, Rebecca; I once thought that I had made the
grand discovery that, if one is only virtuous, one will be happy. I see
now it was too daring, too original&mdash;an immature dream. What bothers me
is that I can't&mdash;somehow I <i>can't</i>&mdash;believe entirely in you&mdash;I am not

It is like this. I want to recover faith in my mission, in my power to
ennoble human souls. And, as a logical thinker, this I cannot do now,

Torvald has just been made a Bank Manager. [<i>Tidies the room.</i>] Isn't it

know. <i>We</i> were poor once, and, do you know, when Torvald was ill,
I&mdash;[<i>tossing her head</i>]&mdash;though I <i>am</i> such a frivolous little squirrel,
and all that, I actually borrowed £300 for him to go abroad. Wasn't
<i>that</i> clever? Tra-la-la! I shan't tell you <i>who</i> lent it. I didn't even
tell Torvald. I am such a mere baby I don't tell him everything. I tell
Dr. Rank, though. Oh, I'm so awfully happy I should like to shout, "Dash

<center><span class="smcap">Krogstad</span>.</center>

<p>[<i>Politely.</i>] Don't mention it. I called because I happened to see your
husband go out with Mrs. Linden&mdash;from which, being a person of
considerable penetration, I infer that he is about to give her my post
at the Bank. Now, as you owe me the balance of £300, for which I hold
your acknowledgment, you will see the propriety of putting a stop to
this little game at once.</p>

<center><span class="smcap">Nora</span>.</center>

<p>But I don't at all&mdash;not a little wee bit! I'm so childish, you know&mdash;why
<i>should</i> I?</p>

<p class="direction">[<i>Sitting upright on carpet.</i></p>

<center><span class="smcap">Krogstad</span>.</center>

<p>I will try to make it plain to the meanest capacity. When you came to me
for the loan, I naturally required some additional security.
Your father, being a shady Government official, without a penny&mdash;for, if
he had possessed one, he would presumably have left it to you&mdash;without a
penny, then&mdash;I, as a cautious man of business, insisted upon having his
signature as a surety. Oh, we Norwegians are sharp fellows!</p>

<center><span class="smcap">Nora</span>.</center>

<p>Well, you <i>got</i> papa's signature, didn't you?</p>

<center><span class="smcap">Krogstad</span>.</center>

<p>Oh, I <i>got</i> it right enough. Unfortunately, it was dated three days
after his decease&mdash;now, how do you account for <i>that</i>?</p>

<center><span class="smcap">Nora</span>.</center>

<p>How? Why, as poor Papa was dead, and couldn't sign, I signed <i>for</i> him,
that's all! Only somehow I forgot to put the date back. <i>That's</i> how.
Didn't I <i>tell</i> you I was a silly, unbusiness like little thing? It's
very simple.</p>

<center><span class="smcap">Krogstad</span>.</center>

<p>Very&mdash;but what you did amounts to forgery, notwithstanding. I happen to
know, because I'm a lawyer, and have done a little in the forging way
myself. So, to come to the point&mdash;if <i>I</i> get kicked out, I shall not go
alone!</p>

<p class="direction">[<i>He bows, and goes out.</i></p>

<center><span class="smcap">Nora</span>.</center>

<p>It <i>can't</i> be wrong! Why, no one but Krogstad would have been taken in
by it! If the Law says it's wrong, the Law's a goose&mdash;a bigger goose
than poor little me even! [<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Helmer</span>, <i>who enters.</i>] Oh, Torvald, how
you made me jump!</p>

<center><span class="smcap">Helmer</span>.</center>

<p>Has anybody called? [<span class="smcap">Nora</span> <i>shakes her head.</i>] Oh, my little squirrel
mustn't tell naughty whoppers. Why, I just met that fellow Krogstad in
the hall. He's been asking you to get me to take him back&mdash;now, hasn't
he?</p>

<center><span class="smcap">Nora</span>.</center>

<p>[<i>Walking about.</i>] Do just see how pretty the Christmas-tree looks!</p>

<center><span class="smcap">Helmer</span>.</center>

<p>Never mind the tree&mdash;I want to have this out about Krogstad. I can't
take him back, because many years ago he forged a name. As a lawyer, a
close observer of human nature, and a Bank Manager, I have remarked that
people who forge names seldom or never confide the fact to their
children&mdash;which inevitably brings moral contagion into the entire
family. From which it follows, logically, that Krogstad has been
poisoning his children for years by acting a part, and is morally lost.
[<i>Stretches out his hands to her.</i>] I can't bear a morally lost
Bank-cashier about me!</p>

<center><span class="smcap">Nora</span>.</center>

<p>But you never thought of dismissing him till Christina came!</p>

<center><span class="smcap">Helmer</span>.</center>

<p>H'm! I've got some business to attend to&mdash;so good-bye, little lark!</p>

<p class="direction">[<i>Goes into office and shuts door.</i></p>

forged a name, I must be poisoning Emmy, and Bob, and Ivar, because <i>I</i>
forged papa's signature! [<i>Short pause; she raises her head proudly.</i>]
After all, if I am a doll, I can still draw a logical inference! I

Torvald is so practical. [<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Mrs. Linden</span>, <i>who comes in with a large

each other in early youth; and when two people knew each other in early
youth&mdash;[<i>a short pause</i>]&mdash;h'm! Besides, he will address me as, "I say,
Torvald"&mdash;which causes me most painful emotion! He is tactless,
dishonest, familiar, and morally ruined&mdash;altogether not at all the kind

housemaids as Bank-messengers. [<i>Goes to door and calls.</i>] Ellen!
[<i>Enter parlourmaid.</i>] Take that letter&mdash;there is no answer. [<span class="smcap">Ellen</span>

afraid you might be contemplating suicide, or something of that kind;

for the complexion, suicide&mdash;and silly, too, because it wouldn't mend
matters in the least. [<i>Kindly.</i>] You must not take this affair too
seriously, Mrs. Helmer. Get your husband to settle it amicably by taking
me back as Cashier; <i>then</i> I shall soon get the whip-hand of <i>him</i>, and

back at any price now!</p>

<p>All right, then. I have here a letter, telling your husband all. I will
take the liberty of dropping it in the letter-box at your hall-door as I
go out. I'll wish you good evening!</p>

<p class="direction">[<i>He goes out; presently the dull sound of a thick letter dropping into

a strictly truthful little dicky-bird. There&mdash;there. [<i>Sits down to

I have given you a secret <i>rendezvous</i> in this room, because it belongs

of Norway permits these slight freedoms on the part of a female
cashier.</p>

<center><span class="smcap">Krogstad</span>.</center>

<p>It does. Are we alone? [<span class="smcap">Nora</span> <i>is heard overhead dancing the

the Tarantella now&mdash;by-and-by she will dance to another tune! [<i>Changing

<center><span class="smcap">Mrs. Linden</span>.</center>

<p>Don't you? <i>I</i> do. I am a widow&mdash;a Norwegian widow. And it has occurred
to me that there may be a nobler side to your nature somewhere&mdash;though
you have not precisely the best of reputations.</p>

<center><span class="smcap">Krogstad</span>.</center>

<p>Right. I am a forger, and a money-lender; I am on the staff of the
Norwegian <i>Punch</i>&mdash;a most scurrilous paper. More, I have been
blackmailing Mrs. Helmer by trading on her fears, like a low cowardly
cur. But, in spite of all that&mdash;[<i>clasping his hands</i>]&mdash;there are the

<center><span class="smcap">Mrs. Linden</span>.</center>

<p>How can you think so? I am her dearest friend; but I can still see her
faults, and it is my firm opinion that a sharp lesson will do her all

<p>Exactly. Sit down, and we will talk it over first. [<i>Slowly.</i>] Has it
ever struck you that this is the first time you and I have ever talked
seriously together about serious things?</p>

<center><span class="smcap">Helmer</span>.</center>

<p>Come, I do like that! How on earth could we talk about serious things
when your mouth was always full of macaroons?</p>

<center><span class="smcap">Nora</span>.</center>

<p>[<i>Shakes her head.</i>] Ah, Torvald, the mouth of a mother of a family
should have more solemn things in it than macaroons! I see that now, too
late. No, you have wronged me. So did papa. Both of you called me a
doll, and a squirrel, and a lark! You might have made something of
me&mdash;and instead of that, you went and made too much of me&mdash;oh, you
<i>did</i>!</p>

<center><span class="smcap">Helmer</span>.</center>

<p>Well, you didn't seem to object to it, and really I don't exactly see
what it is you <i>do</i> want!</p>

<center><span class="smcap">Nora</span>.</center>

<p>No more do I&mdash;that is what I have got to find out. If I had been
properly educated, I should have known better than to date poor papa's
signature three days after he died. Now I must educate <i>myself</i>. I have
to gain experience, and get clear about religion, and law, and things,
and whether Society is right or I am&mdash;and I must go away and never come
back any more till I <i>am</i> educated!</p>

<center><center><span class="smcap">Helmer.</span></center></center>

<p>Then you may be away some little time? And what's to become of me and
the eggs meanwhile?</p>

<center><span class="smcap">Nora</span>.</center>

<p>That, Torvald, is entirely your own affair. I have a higher duty than
that towards you and the eggs. [<i>Looking solemnly upward.</i>] I mean my
duty towards Myself!</p>

<center><center><span class="smcap">Helmer.</span></center></center>

<p>And all this because&mdash;in a momentary annoyance at finding myself in the
power of a discharged cashier who calls me "I say, Torvald," I expressed
myself with ultra-Gilbertian frankness! You talk like a silly child!</p>

<center><span class="smcap">Nora</span>.</center>

<p>Because my eyes are opened, and I see my position with the eyes of
Ibsen. I must go away at once, and begin to educate myself.</p>

<center><center><span class="smcap">Helmer.</span></center></center>

<p>May I ask how you are going to set about it?</p>

<center><span class="smcap">Nora</span>.</center>

<p>Certainly. I shall begin&mdash;yes, I shall <i>begin</i> with a course of the
Norwegian theatres. If <i>that</i> doesn't take the frivolity out of me, I
don't really know what <i>will</i>!</p>

<p class="direction">[<i>She gets her bonnet and ties it tightly.</i></p>

are all closed at this hour&mdash;and so I thought I wouldn't leave the cage
till to-morrow&mdash;after breakfast.</p>

<center><span class="smcap">Helmer.</span></center>

<p>[<i>Patting her on the back.</i>] Yes, Hedda, she did, and the parasol too!
Fancy, Aunt Julie always positively thinks of everything, eh?</p>

<center><span class="smcap">Hedda.</span></center>

<p>[<i>Coldly.</i>] You hold <i>your</i> tongue. Catch me going out walking with your
aunt! One doesn't <i>do</i> such things.</p>

<center><span class="smcap">George.</span></center>

<p>[<i>Beaming.</i>] Isn't she a charming woman? Such fascinating manners! My
goodness, eh? Fancy that!</p>

<center><span class="smcap">Aunt Julie.</span></center>

<p>Ah, dear George, you ought indeed to be happy&mdash;but [<i>brings out a flat

<center><span class="smcap">George.</span></center>

<p>[<i>Opens it.</i>] What? my dear old morning shoes! my slippers! [<i>Breaks
down.</i>] This is positively too touching, Hedda, eh? Do you remember how
badly I wanted them all the honeymoon? Come and just have a look at
them&mdash;you <i>may</i>!</p>

<center><span class="smcap">Hedda.</span></center>

<p>Bother your old slippers and your old aunt too! [<span class="smcap">aunt Julie</span> <i>goes out
annoyed, followed by</i> <span class="smcap">George</span>, <i>still thanking her warmly for the
slippers;</i> <span class="smcap">Hedda</span> <i>yawns;</i> <span class="smcap">George</span> <i>comes back and places his old slippers
reverently on the table.</i>] Why, here comes Mrs. Elvsted&mdash;<i>another</i> early
caller! She had irritating hair, and went about making a sensation with
it&mdash;an old flame of yours, I've heard.</p>

<p class="direction"><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Mrs. Elvsted</span>; <i>she is pretty and gentle, with copious wavy
white-gold hair and round prominent eyes, and the manner of a frightened
rabbit.</i></p>

<center><span class="smcap">Mrs. Elvsted.</span></center>

<p>[<i>Nervous.</i>] Oh, please, I'm so perfectly in despair. Ejlert Lövborg,
you know, who was our tutor; he's written such a large new book. I
inspired him. Oh, I know I don't look like it&mdash;but I did&mdash;he told me so.
And, good gracious! now he's in this dangerous wicked town all alone,
and he's a reformed character, and I'm <i>so</i> frightened about him; so, as
the wife of a sheriff twenty years older than me, I came up to look
after Mr. Lövborg. Do ask him here&mdash;then I can meet him. You will? How
perfectly lovely of you! My husband's <i>so</i> fond of him!</p>

<center><span class="smcap">Hedda.</span></center>

<p>George, go and write an invitation at once; do you hear? [<span class="smcap">George</span> <i>looks
around for his slippers, takes them up and goes out.</i>] Now we can talk,
my little Thea. Do you remember how I used to pull your hair when we met
on the stairs, and say I would scorch it off? Seeing people with copious
hair always <i>does</i> irritate me.</p>

<center><span class="smcap">Mrs. Elvsted.</span></center>

<p>Goodness, yes, you were always so playful and friendly, and I was so
afraid of you. I am still. And please, I've run away from my husband.
Everything around him was distasteful to me. And Mr. Lövborg and I were
comrades&mdash;he was dissipated, and I got a sort of power over him, and he
made a real person out of me&mdash;which I wasn't before, you know; but, oh,
I do hope I'm real now. He talked to me and taught me to think&mdash;chiefly
of him. So, when Mr. Lövborg came here, naturally I came too. There was
nothing else to do! And fancy, there is another woman whose shadow still
stands between him and me! She wanted to shoot him once, and so, of
course, he can never forget her. I wish I knew her name&mdash;perhaps it was
that red-haired opera-singer?</p>

<center><span class="smcap">Hedda.</span></center>

<p>[<i>With cold self-command.</i>] Very likely&mdash;but nobody does that sort of
thing here. Hush! Run away now. Here comes Tesman with Judge Brack.
[<span class="smcap">Mrs. Elvsted</span> <i>goes out;</i> <span class="smcap">George</span> <i>comes in with</i> <span class="smcap">Judge Brack</span>, <i>who is a
short and elastic gentleman, with a round face, carefully brushed hair,
and distinguished profile.</i>] How awfully funny you do look by daylight,
Judge!</p>

<center><span class="smcap">Brack.</span></center>

<p>[<i>Holding his hat and dropping his eye-glass.</i>] Sincerest thanks. Still
the same graceful manners, dear little Mrs. Hed&mdash;Tesman! I came to
invite dear Tesman to a little bachelor-party to celebrate his return
from his long honeymoon. It is customary in Scandinavian society. It
will be a lively affair, for I am a gay Norwegian dog.</p>

<center><span class="smcap">Brack.</span></center>

<p>By the way, Lövborg is here; he has written a wonderful book, which has
made a quite extraordinary sensation. Bless me, yes!</p>

<center><span class="smcap">George.</span></center>

<p>Lövborg&mdash;fancy! Well, I <i>am</i>&mdash;glad. Such marvellous gifts! And I was so

<center><span class="smcap">Brack.</span></center>

<p>Well, he may possibly put up for the Professorship against you, and,
though you <i>are</i> an uncommonly clever man of letters&mdash;for a
Norwegian&mdash;it's not wholly improbable that he may cut you out!</p>

<center><span class="smcap">George.</span></center>

<p>But, look here, good Lord, Judge Brack!&mdash;[<i>gesticulating</i>]&mdash;that would
show an incredible want of consideration for me! I married on my chance
of <i>getting</i> that professorship. A man like Lövborg, too, who hasn't
even been respectable, eh? One doesn't do such things as that!</p>

<center><span class="smcap">Brack.</span></center>

<p>Really? You forget we are all realistic and unconventional persons here,

<p>Invariably, when they come by the back-garden. It is my unconventional

realistic dramas, you know. And I was only aiming at the blue sky.</p>

<center><span class="smcap">Brack</span>.</center>

<p>Which accounts for the condition of my hat. [<i>Exhibiting it.</i>] Look

<p>[<i>Sympathetically.</i>] Our excellent Tesman is certainly a bit of a bore.
[<i>Looks searchingly at her.</i>] What on earth made you marry him?</p>

<center><span class="smcap">Hedda.</span></center>

<p>Tired of dancing, my dear, that's all. And then I used Tesman to take me
home from parties; and we saw this villa; and I said I liked it, and so
did he; and so we found some common ground, and here we are, do you
see! And I loathe Tesman, and I don't even like the villa now; and I do
feel the want of an entertaining companion so!</p>

<center><span class="smcap">Brack.</span></center>

<p>Try me. Just the kind of three-cornered arrangement that I like. Let me

<p>No, he must stop and read it to me and Mrs. Elvsted instead.</p>

you going to oppose me for the professorship, eh?</p>

Thea, sit down and drink up a good glass of cold punch. Mr. Lövborg is
going to have some. If you don't, Mr. Lövborg, George and the Judge will

<p>Oh, please, Hedda! When I've inspired Mr. Lövborg so&mdash;good gracious!

<center><span class="smcap">George.</span></center>

<p>Good Lord! He had the courage to get more drunk than most people. But,
altogether, it was what you might almost call a Bacchanalian orgy. We
finished up by going to have early coffee with some of these jolly
chaps, and poor old Lövborg dropped his precious manuscript in the mud,
and I picked it up&mdash;and here it is! Fancy if anything were to happen to

<center><span class="smcap">George.</span></center>

<p>I am <i>so</i> uneasy about poor Lövborg. Fancy! he is not at home. Mrs.
Elvsted told me he has been here early this morning, so I suppose you
gave him back his manuscript, eh?</p>

<center><span class="smcap">Hedda.</span></center>

<p>[<i>Cold and immovable, supported by arm-chair.</i>] No, I put it on the fire
instead.</p>

<center><span class="smcap">George.</span></center>

<p>On the fire! Lövborg's wonderful new book that he read to me at Brack's
party, when we had that wild revelry last night! Fancy <i>that</i>! But, I
say, Hedda&mdash;isn't that <i>rather</i>&mdash;eh? <i>Too</i> bad, you know&mdash;really. A
great work like that. How on earth did you come to think of it?</p>

<center><span class="smcap">Hedda.</span></center>

<p>[<i>Suppressing an almost imperceptible smile.</i>] Well, dear George, you
gave me a tolerably strong hint.</p>

<center><span class="smcap">George.</span></center>

<p>Me? Well, to be sure&mdash;that <i>is</i> a joke! Why, I only said that I envied
him for writing such a book, and it would put me entirely in the shade
if it came out, and if anything was to happen to it, I should never
forgive myself, as poor Lövborg couldn't write it all over again, and so
we must take the greatest care of it! And then I left it on a chair and
went away&mdash;that was all! And you went and burnt the book all up! Bless
me, who <i>would</i> have expected it?</p>

<center><span class="smcap">Hedda.</span></center>

<p>Nobody, you dear simple old soul! But I did it for your sake&mdash;it was
<i>love</i>, George!</p>

<center><span class="smcap">George.</span></center>

<p>[<i>In an outburst between doubt and joy.</i>] Hedda, you don't mean that!
Your love takes such queer forms sometimes. Yes, but yes&mdash;&mdash;[<i>laughing in
excess of joy</i>] why, you <i>must</i> be fond of me! Just think of that now!
Well, you <i>are</i> fun, Hedda! Look here, I must just run and tell the
housemaid that&mdash;she will enjoy the joke so, eh?</p>

<center><span class="smcap">Hedda.</span></center>

<p>[<i>Coldly, in self-command.</i>] It is surely not necessary even for a
clever Norwegian man of letters in a realistic social drama, to make
quite such a fool of himself as all that.</p>

<center><span class="smcap">George.</span></center>

<p>No, that's true too. Perhaps we'd better keep it quiet&mdash;though I <i>must</i>
tell Aunt Julie&mdash;it will make her so happy to hear that you burnt a
manuscript on my account! And, besides, I should like to ask her whether
that's a usual thing with young wives. [<i>Looks uneasy and pensive
again.</i>] But poor old Ejlert's manuscript! Oh Lor', you know! Well,
well!</p>

<p class="direction">[<span class="smcap">Mrs. Elvsted</span> <i>comes in.</i></p>

<center><span class="smcap">Mrs. Elvsted.</span></center>

<p>Oh, please, I'm so uneasy about dear Mr. Lövborg. Something has happened
to him, I'm sure!</p>

<p class="direction">[<span class="smcap">Judge Brack</span> <i>comes in from the hall, with a new hat in his hand.</i></p>

<p>You have guessed it, first time. Something <i>has</i>!</p>

<center><span class="smcap">Mrs. Elvsted.</span></center>

<p>Oh, dear, good gracious! What is it? Something distressing, I'm certain
of it!</p>

<p class="direction">[<i>Shrieks aloud.</i></p>

<center><span class="smcap">Brack.</span></center>

<p>[<i>Pleasantly.</i>] That depends on how one takes it. He has shot himself,
and is in a hospital now, that's all!</p>

<center><span class="smcap">George.</span></center>

<p>[<i>Sympathetically.</i>] That's sad, eh? poor old Lövborg! Well, I <i>am</i> cut
up to hear that. Fancy, though, eh?</p>

<center><span class="smcap">Hedda.</span></center>

<p>Was it through the temple, or through the breast? The breast? Well, one
can do it beautifully through the breast, too. Do you know, as an
advanced woman, I like an act of that sort&mdash;it's so positive to have the
courage to settle the account with himself&mdash;it's beautiful, really!</p>

<center><span class="smcap">Mrs. Elvsted.</span></center>

<p>Oh, Hedda, what an odd way to look at it! But never mind poor dear Mr.
Lövborg now. What <i>we've</i> got to do is to see if we can't put his
wonderful manuscript, that he said he had torn to pieces, together
again. [<i>Takes a bundle of small pages out of the pocket of her
mantle.</i>] There are the loose scraps he dictated it to me from. I hid
them on the chance of some such emergency. And if dear Mr. Tesman and I
were to put our heads together, I <i>do</i> think something might come of it.</p>

<center><span class="smcap">George.</span></center>

<p>Fancy! I will dedicate my life&mdash;or all I can spare of it&mdash;to the task. I
seem to feel I owe him some slight amends, perhaps. No use crying over
spilt milk, eh, Mrs. Elvsted? We'll sit down&mdash;just you and I&mdash;in the
back drawing-room, and see if you can't inspire me as you did him, eh?</p>

<center><span class="smcap">Mrs. Elvsted.</span></center>

<p>Oh, goodness, yes! I should like it&mdash;if it only might be possible!</p>

<p class="direction">[<span class="smcap">George</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Mrs. Elvsted</span> <i>go into the back drawing-room and become

room, and a little later</i> <span class="smcap">Brack</span> <i>crosses over to her</i></p>

<center><span class="smcap">Hedda.</span></center>

<p>[<i>In a low tone.</i>] Oh, Judge, <i>what</i> a relief to know that
everything&mdash;including Lövborg's pistol&mdash;went off so well! In the breast!
Isn't there a veil of unintentional beauty in that? Such an act of
voluntary courage, too!</p>

<center><span class="smcap">Brack.</span></center>

<p>[<i>Smiles.</i>] H'm!&mdash;perhaps, dear Mrs. Hedda&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<center><span class="smcap">Hedda.</span></center>

<p>[<i>Enthusiastically.</i>] But <i>wasn't</i> it sweet of him! To have the courage
to live his own life after his own fashion&mdash;to break away from the
banquet of life&mdash;<i>so</i> early and <i>so</i> drunk! A beautiful act like that
<i>does</i> appeal to a superior woman's imagination!</p>

<center><span class="smcap">Brack.</span></center>

<p>Sorry to shatter your poetical illusions, little Mrs. Hedda, but, as a
matter of fact, our lamented friend met his end under other
circumstances. The shot did <i>not</i> strike him in the <i>breast</i>&mdash;but&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p class="direction">[<i>Pauses.</i></p>

<center><span class="smcap">Hedda.</span></center>

<p>[<i>Excitedly.</i>] General Gabler's pistols! I might have known it! Did they

<center><span class="smcap">Brack.</span></center>

<p>[<i>In a discreet undertone.</i>] A little lower down!</p>

<p>Oh, <i>how</i> disgusting!&mdash;how vulgar!&mdash;how ridiculous!&mdash;like everything
else about me!</p>

<center><span class="smcap">Brack.</span></center>

<p>Yes, we're realistic types of human nature, and all that&mdash;but a trifle
squalid, perhaps. And why did you give Lövborg your pistol, when it was
certain to be traced by the police? For a charming cold-blooded woman
with a clear head and no scruples, wasn't it just a leetle foolish!</p>

<center><span class="smcap">Hedda.</span></center>

<p>Perhaps; but I wanted him to do it beautifully, and he didn't! Oh, I've
just admitted that I <i>did</i> give him the pistol&mdash;how annoyingly unwise of
me! Now I'm in <i>your</i> power, I suppose?</p>

<center><span class="smcap">Brack.</span></center>

<p>Precisely&mdash;for some reason it's not easy to understand. But it's
inevitable, and you know how you dread anything approaching scandal. All
your past proceedings show that. [<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">George</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Mrs. Elvsted</span> <i>who
come in together from the back-room.</i>] Well, how are you getting on with
the reconstruction of poor Lövborg's great work, eh?</p>

<center><span class="smcap">George.</span></center>

<p>Capitally; we've made out the first two parts already. And really,
Hedda, I do believe Mrs. Elvsted <i>is</i> inspiring me; I begin to feel it
coming on. Fancy that!</p>

<center><span class="smcap">Mrs. Elvsted.</span></center>

take any photographs, so I <i>had</i> to.</p>

<center><span class="smcap">Hialmar.</span></center>

<p>All the same&mdash;it was a swamp of deceit. And where am I to find
elasticity of spirit to bring out my grand invention now? I used to shut
myself up in the parlour, and ponder and cry, when I thought that the
effort of inventing anything would sap my vitality. [<i>Pathetically.</i>] I
<i>did</i> want to leave you an inventor's widow; but I never shall now,
particularly as I haven't made up my mind what to invent yet. Yes, it's
all over. Rabbits are trash, and even poultry palls. And I'll wring that
cursed Wild Duck's neck!</p>

<center><span class="smcap">Gregers.</span></center>

<p>[<i>Coming in beaming.</i>] Well, so you've got it over. <i>Wasn't</i> it soothing

<p>[<i>In great surprise.</i>] Bless me! Pardon my Norwegian <i>naïveté</i>, but this

expected to have found you both beaming!&mdash;Mrs. Ekdal, being so

your deep mind, surely <i>you</i> feel a new consecration, eh?</p>

astonishing coincidences open up! <i>I</i> am not short-sighted, at all
events, and I see it all&mdash;all! <i>This</i> is my answer. [<i>He takes the deed,

[<i>Puts on overcoat.</i>] My home has fallen in ruins about me. [<i>Bursts

<center><span class="smcap">Gregers.</span></center>

<p>Oh, but you <i>mustn't</i> go. You must be all three together, to attain the

<p>A good deal of tomfool rubbish! I'm illiterate, I know. I've been a Wild
Duck in my time, and I waddle. But for all that, I'm the only person in
the play with a grain of common-sense. And I'm sure&mdash;whatever Mr. Ibsen
or Gregers choose to say&mdash;that a screaming burlesque like this ought
<i>not</i> to end like a tragedy&mdash;even in this queer Norway of ours! And it
shan't, either! Tell the child to put that nasty pigstol down, and come

<p>[<i>Depressed.</i>] Oh, but this is hopeless! When I have tried so hard to

<center><span class="smcap">Mrs. Herdal</span>.</center>

<p>[<i>Feels gropingly for a chair, and sits down on the floor.</i>] Him, <i>too</i>!
Ah, Haustus, you will never make my home a real home for me. My poor
first husband, Halvard Solness, tried&mdash;and <i>he</i> couldn't! When one has
had such misfortunes as I have&mdash;all the family portraits burnt, and the
silk dresses, too, and a pair of twins, and nine lovely dolls.</p>

<p class="direction">[<i>Chokes with tears.</i></p>

<center><span class="smcap">Dr. Herdal</span>.</center>

<p>[<i>As if to lead her away from the subject.</i>] Yes, yes, yes, that must
have been a heavy blow for you, my poor Aline. I can understand that
your spirits can never be really high again. And then for poor Master
Builder Solness to be so taken up with that Miss Wangel as he was&mdash;that,
too, was so wretched for you. To see him topple off the tower, as he did
that day ten years ago&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<center><span class="smcap">Mrs. Herdal</span>.</center>

<p>Yes, that too, Haustus. But I did not mind it so much&mdash;it all seemed so
perfectly natural in both of them.</p>

<center><span class="smcap">Dr. Herdal</span>.</center>

<p>Natural! For a girl of twenty three to taunt a middle-aged architect,
whom she knew to be constitutionally liable to giddiness, never to let
him have any peace till he had climbed a spire as dizzy as himself&mdash;and
all for the fun of seeing him fall off&mdash;how in the world&mdash;&mdash;!</p>

<center><span class="smcap">Mrs. Herdal</span>.</center>

<p>[<i>Laying the table for supper with dried fish and punch.</i>] The younger
generation have a keener sense of humour than we elder ones, Haustus,
and perhaps after all, she was only a perplexing sort of allegory.</p>

<center><span class="smcap">Dr. Herdal</span>.</center>

<p>Yes, that would explain her to some extent, no doubt. But how <i>he</i> could
be such an old fool!</p>

<center><span class="smcap">Mrs. Herdal.</span></center>

<p>That Miss Wangel was a strangely fascinating type of girl. Why, even I
myself&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<center><span class="smcap">Dr. Herdal.</span></center>

<p>[<i>Sits down and takes some fish.</i>] Fascinating? Well, goodness knows, I
couldn't see <i>that</i> at all. [<i>Seriously.</i>] Has it never struck you,
Aline, that elderly Norwegians are so deucedly impressionable&mdash;mere
bundles of overstrained nerves, hypersensitive ganglia. Except, of
course, the Medical Profession.</p>

<center><span class="smcap">Mrs. Herdal.</span></center>

<p>Yes, of course; those in that profession are not so inclined to gangle.
And when one has succeeded by such a stroke of luck as you have&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<center><span class="smcap">Dr. Herdal.</span></center>

<p>[<i>Drinks a glass of punch.</i>] You're right enough there. If I had not
been called in to prescribe for Dr. Ryval, who used to have the leading
practice here, I should never have stepped so wonderfully into his
shoes as I did. [<i>Changes to a tone of quiet chuckling merriment.</i>] Let
me tell you a funny story, Aline; it sounds a ludicrous thing&mdash;but all
my good fortune here was based upon a simple little pill. For if Dr.
Ryval had never taken it&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<center><span class="smcap">Mrs. Herdal.</span></center>

<p>[<i>Anxiously.</i>] Then you <i>do</i> think it was the pill that caused him
to&mdash;&mdash;?</p>

<center><span class="smcap">Dr. Herdal.</span></center>

<p>On the contrary; I am perfectly sure the pill had nothing whatever to do
with it&mdash;the inquest made it quite clear that it was really the
liniment. But don't you see, Aline, what tortures me night and day is
the thought that it <i>might</i> unconsciously have been the pill which&mdash;&mdash;
Never to be free from <i>that</i>! To have such a thought gnawing and burning
always&mdash;always, like a moral mustard plaster!</p>

<p class="direction">[<i>He takes more punch.</i></p>

<center><span class="smcap">Mrs. Herdal.</span></center>

<p>Yes; I suppose there is a poultice of that sort burning on every
breast&mdash;and we must never take it off either&mdash;it is our simple duty to
keep it on. I too, Haustus, am haunted by a fancy that if this Miss
Wangel were to ring at our bell now&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<center><span class="smcap">Dr. Herdal.</span></center>

<p>After she has been lost sight of for ten years? She is safe enough in
some sanatorium, depend upon it. And what if she <i>did</i> come? Do you
think, my dear good woman, that I&mdash;a sensible clear-headed general
practitioner, who have found out all I know for myself&mdash;would let her
play the deuce with me as she did with poor Halvard? No, general
practitioners don't <i>do</i> such things&mdash;even in Norway!</p>

<center><span class="smcap">Mrs. Herdal.</span></center>

<p>Don't they indeed, Haustus? [<i>The surgery-bell rings loudly.</i>] Did you
hear <i>that</i>? There she is! I will go and put on my best cap. It is my
duty to show her <i>that</i> small attention.</p>

<center><span class="smcap">Dr. Herdal.</span></center>

<center><span class="smcap">Hilda.</span></center>

<p>As if <i>that</i> mattered&mdash;it's only dear, sweet Mrs. Solness. <i>She</i> doesn't
mind&mdash;<i>do</i> you, dear Mrs. Solness?</p>

<center><span class="smcap">Mrs. Herdal.</span></center>

<p>It does not seem to be of much <i>use</i> minding, Miss Wangel. I presume you
have come to stay?</p>

<center><span class="smcap">Hilda.</span></center>

<p>[<i>In amused surprise.</i>] Why, of course&mdash;what else should I come for? I
<i>always</i> come to stay, until&mdash;h'm! [<i>Nods slowly, and sits down at
table.</i></p>

<center><span class="smcap">Dr. Herdal.</span></center>

<p>[<i>Involuntarily.</i>] She's drinking my punch! If she thinks I'm going to
stand this sort of thing, she's mistaken. I'll soon show her a
pill-doctor is a very different kind of person from a mere Master
Builder!</p>

<p class="direction">[<span class="smcap">Hilda</span> <i>finishes the punch with an indefinable expression in her eyes,

<h3><a name="ACT_SECOND4" id="ACT_SECOND4"></a>ACT SECOND</h3>

<p class="hangindent"><span class="smcap">Dr. Herdal's</span> <i>drawing-room and dispensary, as before. It is early in the
day.</i> <span class="smcap">Dr. Herdal</span> <i>sits by the little table, taking his own temperature
with a clinical thermometer. By the door stands the</i> <span class="smcap">New Book-keeper</span>;
<i>he wears blue spectacles and a discoloured white tie, and seems
slightly nervous</i>.</p>

<center><span class="smcap">Dr. Herdal.</span></center>

<p>Well, now you understand what is necessary. My late book-keeper, Miss
Blakdraf, used to keep my accounts very cleverly&mdash;she charged every
visit twice over.</p>

<center><span class="smcap">The New Book-keeper.</span></center>

<p>I am familiar with book-keeping by double entry. I was once employed at
a bank.</p>

<center><span class="smcap">Dr. Herdal.</span></center>

<p>I am discharging my assistant, too; he was always trying to push me out
with his pills. Perhaps you will be able to dispense?</p>

<center><span class="smcap">The New Book-keeper.</span></center>

<p>[<i>Modestly.</i>] With an additional salary, I should be able to do that
too.</p>

<center><span class="smcap">Dr. Herdal.</span></center>

<p>Capital! You <i>shall</i> dispense with an additional salary. Go into the
dispensary, and see what you can make of it. You may mistake a few drugs
at first&mdash;but everything must have a beginning.</p>

<p class="direction">[<i>As the</i> <span class="smcap">New Book-keeper</span> <i>retires</i>, <span class="smcap">Mrs. Herdal</span> <i>enters in a hat and
cloak with a watering-pot, noiselessly</i>.</p>

<center><span class="smcap">Mrs. Herdal.</span></center>

<p>Miss Wangel got up early, before breakfast, and went for a walk. She is
so wonderfully vivacious!</p>

<center><span class="smcap">Dr. Herdal.</span></center>

<p>So I should say. But tell me, Aline, is she <i>really</i> going to stay with
us here?</p>

<p class="direction">[<i>Nervously.</i></p>

<center><span class="smcap">Mrs. Herdal.</span></center>

<p>[<i>Looks at him.</i>] So she tells me. And, as she has brought nothing with
her except a tooth-brush and a powder-puff, I am going into the town to
get her a few articles. We <i>must</i> make her feel at home.</p>

<center><span class="smcap">Dr. Herdal.</span></center>

<p>[<i>Breaking out.</i>] I <i>will</i> make her not only <i>feel</i> but <i>be</i> at home,
wherever that is, this very day! I will <i>not</i> have a perambulating
Allegory without a portmanteau here on an indefinite visit. I say, she
shall go&mdash;do you hear, Aline? Miss Wangel will go!</p>

<p class="direction">[<i>Raps with his fist on table.</i></p>

<center><span class="smcap">Mrs. Herdal.</span></center>

<p>[<i>Quietly.</i>] If you say so, Haustus, no doubt she will <i>have</i> to go. But
you must tell her so yourself.</p>

<p class="direction">[<i>Puts the watering-pot on the console table, and goes out, as</i> <span class="smcap">Hilda</span>
<i>enters, sparkling with pleasure</i>.</p>

<center><span class="smcap">Hilda.</span></center>

<p>[<i>Goes up straight to him.</i>] Good morning, Dr. Herdal. I have just seen
a pig killed. It was <i>ripping</i>&mdash;I mean, gloriously thrilling! And your
wife has taken a tremendous fancy to me. Fancy <i>that</i>!</p>

<center><span class="smcap">Dr. Herdal.</span></center>

<p>[<i>Gloomily.</i>] It <i>is</i> eccentric certainly. But my poor dear wife was
always a little&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<center><span class="smcap">Hilda.</span></center>

<p>[<i>Nods her head slowly several times.</i>] So <i>you</i> have noticed that too?
I have had a long talk with her. She can't get over your discharging Mr.
Kalomel&mdash;he is the only man who ever <i>really</i> understood her.</p>

<center><span class="smcap">Dr. Herdal.</span></center>

<p>If I could only pay her off a little bit of the huge, immeasurable debt
I owe her&mdash;but I can't!</p>

<center><span class="smcap">Hilda.</span></center>

<p>[<i>Looks hard at him.</i>] Can't <i>I</i> help you? I helped Ragnar Brovik.
Didn't you know I stayed with him and poor little Kaia&mdash;after that
accident to my Master Builder? I did. I made Ragnar build me the
loveliest castle in the air&mdash;lovelier, even, than poor Mr. Solness's
would have been&mdash;and we stood together on the very top. The steps were
rather too much for Kaia. Besides, there was no room for her on top. And
he put towering spires on all his semi-detached villas. Only, somehow,
they didn't let. Then the castle in the air tumbled down, and Ragnar
went into liquidation, and I continued my walking-tour.</p>

<center><span class="smcap">Dr. Herdal.</span></center>

<p>[<i>Interested against his will.</i>] And where did you go after <i>that</i>, may
I ask, Miss Wangel?</p>

<center><span class="smcap">Hilda.</span></center>

<p>Oh, ever so far north. There I met Mr. and Mrs. Tesman&mdash;the second Mrs.
Tesman&mdash;she who was Mrs. Elvsted, with the irritating hair, you know.
They were on their honeymoon, and had just decided that it was
impossible to reconstruct poor Mr. Lövborg's great book out of Mrs.
Elvsted's rough notes. But I insisted on George's attempting the
impossible&mdash;with Me. And what <i>do</i> you think Mrs. Tesman wears in her
hair <i>now</i>?</p>

<center><span class="smcap">Dr. Herdal.</span></center>

<p>Why, really I could not say. Vine-leaves, perhaps.</p>

<center><span class="smcap">Hilda.</span></center>

<p>Wrong&mdash;<i>straws</i>! Poor Tesman <i>didn't</i> fancy that&mdash;so he shot himself,
<i>un</i>-beautifully, through his ticket-pocket. And I went on and took
Rosmershölm for the summer. There had been misfortune in the house, so
it was to let. Dear good old Rector Kroll acted as my reference; his
wife and children had no sympathy with his views, so I used to see him
every day. And I persuaded him, too, to attempt the impossible&mdash;he had
never ridden anything but a rocking-horse in his life, but I made him
promise to mount the White Horse of Rosmershölm. He didn't get over
<i>that</i>. They found his body, a fortnight afterwards, in the mill-dam.
Thrilling!</p>

<center><span class="smcap">Dr. Herdal.</span></center>

<p>[<i>Shakes his finger at her.</i>] What a girl you are, Miss Wangel! But you
mustn't play these games <i>here</i>, you know.</p>

<center><span class="smcap">Hilda.</span></center>

<p>[<i>Laughs to herself.</i>] Of course not. But I suppose I <i>am</i> a strange
sort of bird.</p>

<center><span class="smcap">Dr. Herdal.</span></center>

<p>You are like a strong tonic. When I look at you I seem to be regarding
an effervescing saline draught. Still, I really must decline to take
you.</p>

<center><span class="smcap">Hilda.</span></center>

<p>[<i>A little sulky.</i>] That is not how you spoke ten years ago, up at the
mountain station, when you were such a flirt!</p>

<center><span class="smcap">Dr. Herdal.</span></center>

<p><i>Was</i> I a flirt? Deuce take me if I remember. But I am not like that
<i>now</i>.</p>

<center><span class="smcap">Hilda.</span></center>

<p>Then you have really forgotten how you sat next to me at the <i>table
d'hôte</i>, and made pills and swallowed them, and were so splendid and
buoyant and free that all the old women who knitted left next day?</p>

<center><span class="smcap">Dr. Herdal.</span></center>

<p>What a memory you have for trifles, Miss Wangel; it's quite wonderful!</p>

<center><span class="smcap">Hilda.</span></center>

<p>Trifles! There was no trifling on <i>your</i> part. When you promised to come
back in ten years, like a troll, and fetch me!</p>

<center><span class="smcap">Dr. Herdal.</span></center>

<p>Did I say all that? It <i>must</i> have been <i>after table d'hôte</i>!</p>

<center><span class="smcap">Hilda.</span></center>

<p>It was. I was a mere chit then&mdash;only twenty-three; but <i>I</i> remember. And
now <i>I</i> have come for <i>you</i>.</p>

<center><span class="smcap">Dr. Herdal.</span></center>

<p>Dear, dear! But there is nothing of the troll about me now I have
married Mrs. Solness.</p>

<center><span class="smcap">Hilda.</span></center>

<p>[<i>Looking sharply at him.</i>] Yes, I remember you were always dropping in
to tea in those days.</p>

<center><span class="smcap">Dr. Herdal.</span></center>

<p>[<i>Seems hurt.</i>] Every visit was duly put down in the ledger and charged
for&mdash;as poor little Senna will tell you.</p>

<center><span class="smcap">Hilda.</span></center>

<p>Little Senna? Oh, Dr. Herdal, I believe there is a bit of the troll left
in you still!</p>

<center><span class="smcap">Dr. Herdal.</span></center>

<p>[<i>Laughs a little.</i>] No, no; my conscience is perfectly robust&mdash;always
was.</p>

<center><span class="smcap">Hilda.</span></center>

<p>Are you quite <i>quite</i> sure that, when you went indoors with dear Mrs.
Solness that afternoon, and left me alone with my Master Builder, you
did not foresee&mdash;perhaps wish&mdash;intend, even a little, that&mdash;&mdash; H'm?</p>

<center><span class="smcap">Dr. Herdal.</span></center>

<p>That you would talk the poor man into clambering up that tower? You want
to drag <i>Me</i> into that business now!</p>

<center><span class="smcap">Hilda.</span></center>

<p>[<i>Teasingly.</i>] Yes, I certainly think that then you went on exactly like
a troll.</p>

<center><span class="smcap">Dr. Herdal.</span></center>

<p>[<i>With uncontrollable emotion.</i>] Hilda, there is not a corner of me safe
from you! Yes, I see now that <i>must</i> have been the way of it. Then I
<i>was</i> a troll in that, too! But isn't it terrible the price I have had
to pay for it? To have a wife who&mdash;&mdash; No, I shall never roll a pill
again&mdash;never, never!</p>

<center><span class="smcap">Hilda.</span></center>

<p>[<i>Lays her head on the stove, and answers as if half asleep.</i>] No more
pills? Poor Doctor Herdal!</p>

<center><span class="smcap">Dr. Herdal.</span></center>

<p>[<i>Bitterly.</i>] No&mdash;nothing but cosy commonplace grey powders for a whole
troop of children.</p>

<center><span class="smcap">Hilda.</span></center>

<p>[<i>Lively again.</i>.] Not grey powders! [<i>Quite seriously.</i>] I will tell
you what you shall make next. Beautiful rainbow-coloured powders that will give
one a real grip on the world. Powders to make every one free and buoyant, and ready to
grasp at one's own happiness, to <i>dare</i> what one <i>would</i>. I will have
you make them. I will&mdash;I <i>will</i>!</p>

<p>H'm! I am not quite sure that I clearly understand. And then the
ingredients&mdash;&mdash;?</p>

<center><span class="smcap">Hilda.</span></center>

<p>What stupid people all of you pill-doctors are, to be sure! Why, they
will be <i>poisons</i>, of course!</p>

<center><span class="smcap">Dr. Herdal.</span></center>

<p>Poisons? Why in the world should they be <i>that</i>?</p>

<center><span class="smcap">Hilda.</span></center>

<p>[<i>Without answering him.</i>] All the thrillingest, deadliest poisons&mdash;it
is only such things that are wholesome, nowadays.</p>

<center><span class="smcap">Dr. Herdal</span>.</center>

<p>[<i>As if caught by her enthusiasm.</i>] And I could colour them, too, by
exposing them to rays cast through a prism. Oh, Hilda, how I have needed
you all these years! For, you see, with <i>her</i> it was impossible to
discuss such things.</p>

<p class="direction">[<i>Embraces her.</i></p>

<center><span class="smcap">Mrs. Herdal</span>.</center>

<p>[<i>Enters noiselessly through hall-door.</i>] I suppose, Haustus, you are
persuading Miss Wangel to start by the afternoon steamer? I have bought
her a pair of curling-tongs, and a packet of hairpins. The larger
parcels are coming on presently.</p>

<center><span class="smcap">Dr. Herdal</span>.</center>

<p>[<i>Uneasily.</i>] H'm! Hilda&mdash;Miss Wangel I <i>should</i> say&mdash;is kindly going to
stay on a little longer, to assist me in some scientific experiments.
You wouldn't understand them if I told you.</p>

<center><span class="smcap">Mrs. Herdal</span>.</center>

<p>Shouldn't I, Haustus? I daresay not.</p>

<center><span class="smcap">Dr. Herdal.</span></center>

<p>[<i>Comes out of dispensary-door cautiously, and whispers.</i>] Hilda, are
you in there?</p>

<p class="direction">[<i>Taps with fingers on drawing-room door.</i></p>

<center><span class="smcap">Hilda.</span></center>

<p>[<i>Comes out with a half-teasing smile.</i>] Well&mdash;and how is the
rainbow-powder getting on, Dr. Herdal?</p>

<center><span class="smcap">Dr. Herdal.</span></center>

<p>[<i>With enthusiasm.</i>] It is getting on simply splendidly. I sent the new
assistant out to take a little walk, so that he should not be in the
way. There is arsenic in the powder, Hilda, and digitalis too, and
strychnine, and the best beetle-killer!</p>

<center><span class="smcap">Hilda.</span></center>

<p>[<i>With happy, wondering eyes.</i>] <i>Lots</i> of beetle-killer. And you will
give some of it to <i>her</i>, to make her free and buoyant. I think one
really <i>has</i> the right&mdash;when people happen to stand in the way&mdash;&mdash;!</p>

<center><span class="smcap">Dr. Herdal.</span></center>

<p>Yes, you may well say so, Hilda. Still&mdash;[<i>dubiously</i>]&mdash;it <i>does</i> occur
to me that such doings may perhaps be misunderstood&mdash;by the
narrow-minded and conventional.</p>

<p class="direction">[<i>They go on the lawn, and sit down.</i></p>

<center><span class="smcap">Hilda.</span></center>

<p>[<i>With an outburst.</i>] Oh, that all seems to me so foolish&mdash;so
irrelevant! As if the whole thing wasn't intended as an allegory!</p>

<center><span class="smcap">Dr. Herdal.</span></center>

<p>[<i>Relieved.</i>] Ah, so long as it is merely <i>allegorical</i>, of course&mdash;&mdash;
But what is it an allegory <i>of</i>, Hilda?</p>

<center><span class="smcap">Hilda.</span></center>

<p>[<i>Reflects in vain.</i>] How can you sit there and ask such questions? I
suppose I am a symbol&mdash;of some sort.</p>

<center><span class="smcap">Dr. Herdal.</span></center>

<p>[<i>As a thought flashes upon him.</i>] A cymbal? That would certainly
account for your bra&mdash;&mdash; Then, am <i>I</i> a cymbal too, Hilda?</p>

<center><span class="smcap">Hilda.</span></center>

<p>Why yes&mdash;what else? You represent the artist-worker, or the elder
generation, or the pursuit of the ideal, or a bilious conscience&mdash;or
something or other. <i>You're</i> all right!</p>

<center><span class="smcap">Dr. Herdal.</span></center>

<p>[<i>Shakes his head.</i>] Am I? But I don't quite see&mdash;&mdash; Well, well, cymbals
are meant to clash a little. And I see plainly now that I ought to
prescribe this powder for as many as possible. Isn't it terrible, Hilda,
that so many poor souls never really die their own deaths&mdash;pass out of
the world without even the formality of an inquest? As the district
Coroner, I feel strongly on the subject.</p>

<center><span class="smcap">Hilda.</span></center>

<p>And, when the Coroner has finished sitting on all the bodies,
perhaps&mdash;but I shan't tell you now. [<i>Speaks as if to a child.</i>] There,
run away and finish making the rainbow-powder, do!</p>

<center><span class="smcap">Dr. Herdal.</span></center>

<p>[<i>Skips up into the dispensary.</i>] I will&mdash;I will! Oh, I do feel such a
troll&mdash;such a light-haired, light-headed old devil!</p>

<center><span class="smcap">Rübub.</span></center>

<p>[<i>Enters garden-gate.</i>] I have had my dismissal&mdash;but I'm not going
without saying good-bye to Mrs. Herdal.</p>

<center><span class="smcap">Hilda.</span></center>

<p>Dr. Herdal would disapprove&mdash;you really must not, Mr. Kalomel. And,
besides, Mrs. Herdal is not at home. She is in the town buying me a reel
of cotton. <i>Dr.</i> Herdal is in. He is making real rainbow powders for
regenerating everybody all round. Won't <i>that</i> be fun?</p>

<center><span class="smcap">Rübub.</span></center>

<p><i>Making</i> powders? Ha! ha! But you will see he won't <i>take</i> one himself.
It is quite notorious to us younger men that he simply daren't do it.</p>

<center><span class="smcap">Hilda.</span></center>

<p>[<i>With a little snort of contempt.</i>] Oh, I daresay&mdash;that's so likely!
[<i>Defiantly.</i>] I know he <i>can</i>, though. I've <i>seen</i> him!</p>

<center><span class="smcap">Rübub.</span></center>

<p>There is a tradition that he once&mdash;but not now&mdash;he knows better. I think
you said Mrs. Herdal was in the town? I will go and look for her. I

<p class="direction">[<i>Goes out by gate.</i></p>

<center><span class="smcap">Dr. Herdal.</span></center>

<p>[<i>Puts his head out.</i>] Just when I am making such wonderful progress
with the powder. [<i>Comes down and leans on a table.</i>] Have you hit upon

arrowroot&mdash;&mdash;?</p>

<center><span class="smcap">Hilda.</span></center>

<p>No, thanks. I won't have that now. I have just recollected that it is a

introduced to. Strangers don't count. No, poor Mrs. Herdal mustn't take
that powder!</p>

<center><span class="smcap">Dr. Herdal.</span></center>

<p>[<i>Disappointed.</i>] Then is nothing to come of making rainbow powders,
after all, Hilda?</p>

<center><span class="smcap">Hilda.</span></center>

<p>[<i>Looks hard at him.</i>] People say you are afraid to take your own
physic. Is that true?</p>

<center><span class="smcap">Dr. Herdal.</span></center>

<p>Yes, I am. [<i>After a pause&mdash;with candour.</i>] I find it invariably
disagrees with me.</p>

<center><span class="smcap">Hilda.</span></center>

<p>[<i>With a half-dubious smile.</i>] I think I can understand <i>that</i>. But you
did <i>once</i>. You swallowed your own pills that day at the <i>table d'hôte</i>,
ten years ago. And I heard a harp in the air, too!</p>

<center><span class="smcap">Dr. Herdal.</span></center>

<p>[<i>Open-mouthed.</i>] I don't think that <i>could</i> have been me. I don't play
any instrument. And that was quite a special thing, too. It's not every
day I can do it. Those were only <i>bread</i> pills, Hilda.</p>

<center><span class="smcap">Hilda.</span></center>

<p>[<i>With flashing eyes.</i>] But you rolled them, you took them. And I want
to see you stand once more free and high and great, swallowing your own
preparations. [<i>Passionately.</i>] I <i>will</i> have you do it!
[<i>Imploringly.</i>] Just <i>once</i> more, Dr. Herdal!</p>

<center><span class="smcap">Dr. Herdal.</span></center>

<p>If I did, Hilda, my medical knowledge, slight as it is, leads me to the
conclusion that I should in all probability burst.</p>

<center><span class="smcap">Hilda.</span></center>

<p>[<i>Looks deeply into his eyes.</i>] So long as you burst <i>beautifully</i>! But
no doubt that Miss Blakdraf&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<center><span class="smcap">Dr. Herdal.</span></center>

<p>You must believe in me utterly and entirely. I will do
anything&mdash;<i>anything</i>, Hilda, to provide you with agreeable

<center><span class="smcap">Rübub.</span></center>

<p>[<i>With cold politeness.</i>] I am sorry to hear it&mdash;for his sake. But it
would be quite contrary to professional etiquette to prevent him.</p>

<center><span class="smcap">Mrs. Herdal.</span></center>

<p>And I never interfere with my husband's proceedings. I know <i>my</i> duty,
Miss Blakdraf, if <i>others</i> don't!</p>

<center><span class="smcap">Hilda.</span></center>

<p>[<i>Exulting with great intensity.</i>] At last! Now I see him in there,
great and free again, mixing the powder in a spoon&mdash;with jam!... Now he
raises the spoon. Higher&mdash;higher still! [<i>A gulp is audible from
within.</i>] There, didn't you hear a harp in the air? [<i>Quietly.</i>] I can't
see the spoon any more. But there is one he is striving with, in blue
spectacles!</p>

<center><span class="smcap">The New Assistant's Voice.</span></center>

<p>[<i>Within.</i>] The Pill-Doctor Herdal has taken his own powder!</p>

<center><span class="smcap">Hilda.</span></center>

<p>[<i>As if petrified.</i>] That voice! <i>Where</i> have I heard it before? No
matter&mdash;he has got the powder down! [<i>Waves a shawl in the air, and
shrieks with wild jubilation.</i>] It's too awfully thrilling! My&mdash;<i>my</i>
Pill-Doctor!</p>

<center><span class="smcap">The New Assistant.</span></center>

<p>[<i>Comes out on verandah.</i>] I am happy to inform you that&mdash;as, to avoid
accidents, I took the simple precaution of filling all the
dispensary-jars with camphorated chalk&mdash;no serious results may be anticipated
from Dr. Herdal's rashness. [<i>Removes spectacles.</i>] Nora, don't
you know me?</p>

<center><span class="smcap">Hilda.</span></center>

<p>[<i>Reflects.</i>] I really don't remember having the pleasure&mdash;&mdash; And I'm
<i>sure</i> I heard a harp in the air!</p>

<center><span class="smcap">Mrs. Herdal.</span></center>

<p>I fancy, Miss Wangel, it must have been merely a bee in your bonnet.</p>

<center><span class="smcap">The New Assistant.</span></center>

<p>[<i>Tenderly.</i>] Still the same little singing-bird! Oh, Nora, my long-lost
lark!</p>

<center><span class="smcap">Hilda.</span></center>

<p>[<i>Sulkily.</i>] I'm <i>not</i> a lark&mdash;I'm a bird of prey&mdash;and when I get my
claws into anything&mdash;&mdash;!</p>

<center><span class="smcap">The New Assistant.</span></center>

<p>Macaroons, for instance? I remember your tastes of old. See, Nora!
[<i>Produces a paper-bag from his coat-tail pocket.</i>] They were fresh this
morning!</p>

<center><span class="smcap">Hilda.</span></center>

<p>[<i>Wavering.</i>] If you insist on calling me Nora, I think you must be just
a little mad yourself.</p>

<center><span class="smcap">The New Assistant.</span></center>

<p>We are all a little mad&mdash;in Norway. But Torvald Helmer is sane enough
still to recognise his own little squirrel again! Surely, Nora, your
education is complete at last&mdash;you have gained the experience you
needed?</p>

<center><span class="smcap">Hilda.</span></center>

<p>[<i>Nods slowly.</i>] Yes, Torvald, you're right enough <i>there</i>. I have
thought things out for myself, and have got clear about them. And I have
quite made up my mind that Society and the Law are all wrong, and that I
am right.</p>

<center><center><span class="smcap">Helmer.</span></center></center>

<p>[<i>Overjoyed.</i>] Then you <i>have</i> learnt the Great Lesson, and are fit to
undertake the charge of your children's education at last! You've no
notion how they've grown! Yes, Nora, our marriage will be a true
marriage now. You will come back to the Dolls' House, won't you?</p>

<center><span class="smcap">Hilda-Nora-Helmer-Wangel.</span></center>

<p>[<i>Hesitates.</i>] Will you let me forge cheques if I do, Torvald?</p>

<center><span class="smcap">Helmer.</span></center>

<p>[<i>Ardently.</i>] All day. And at night, Nora, we will falsify the
accounts&mdash;together!</p>

<center><span class="smcap">Hilda-Nora-Helmer-Wangel.</span></center>

<p>[<i>Throws herself into his arms, and helps herself to macaroons.</i>] That
will be fearfully thrilling! My&mdash;<i>my</i> Manager!</p>

<center><span class="smcap">Dr. Herdal.</span></center>

<p>[<i>Comes out very pale, from dispensary.</i>] Hilda I <i>did</i> take the&mdash;&mdash; I'm
afraid I interrupt you?</p>

<center><span class="smcap">Helmer.</span></center>

<p>Not in the least. But this lady is my little lark, and she is going
back to her cage by the next steamer.</p>

<center><span class="smcap">Dr. Herdal.</span></center>

<p>[<i>Bitterly.</i>] Am I <i>never</i> to have a gleam of happiness? But stay&mdash;do I
see my little Senna once more?</p>

<center><span class="smcap">Rübub.</span></center>

<p>Pardon me&mdash;<i>my</i> little Senna. She always believed so firmly in my pill!</p>

<center><span class="smcap">Dr. Herdal.</span></center>

<p>Well&mdash;well. If it must be. Rübub, I will take you into partnership, and
we will take out a patent for that pill, jointly. Aline, my poor dear
Aline, let us try once more if we cannot bring a ray of brightness into
our cheerless home!</p>

<center><span class="smcap">Mrs. Herdal.</span></center>

<p>Oh, Haustus, if only we <i>could</i>&mdash;but why do you propose that to
me&mdash;<i>now</i>?</p>

<center><span class="smcap">Dr. Herdal.</span></center>

<p>[<i>Softly&mdash;to himself.</i>] Because I have tried being a troll&mdash;and found
that nothing came of it, and it wasn't worth sixpence!</p>

<h3>REMBRANDT:</h3>

<h4>HIS LIFE, HIS WORK, AND HIS TIME.</h4>

<center>BY</center >

<h5>ÉMILE MICHEL,</h5>

<center><i>MEMBER OF THE INSTITUTE OF FRANCE.</i></center><br />

<center>EDITED AND PREFACED BY</center>

<h5>FREDERICK WEDMORE.</h5>

<p>Nothing need be said in justification of a comprehensive book upon the
life and work of Rembrandt. A classic among classics, he is also a
modern of moderns. His works are to-day more sought after and better
paid for than ever before; he is now at the zenith of a fame which can
hardly decline.</p>

<p>The author of this work is perhaps, of all living authorities on
Rembrandt, the one who has had the largest experience, the best
opportunity of knowing all that can be known of the master.</p>

<p>The latest inventions in photogravure and process-engraving have enabled
the publisher to reproduce almost everything that is accessible in the
public galleries of Europe, as well as most of the numerous private
collections containing specimens of Rembrandt's work in England and on
the Continent.</p>

<p>This work will be published in two volumes 4to, each containing over 300
pages. There will be over 30 photogravures, about 40 coloured
reproductions of paintings and chalk drawings, and 250 illustrations in
the text.</p>

<p>Two Editions will be printed&mdash;one on Japanese vellum, limited to 200
numbered copies (for England and America), with duplicates of the plates
on India paper, price <i>£10 10s.</i> net. The ordinary edition will be
published at <i>£2 2s.</i> net.</p>

<p>An illustrated prospectus is now ready and may be had on application.
Orders will be received by all booksellers, in town and country.</p>

4to, cloth, <i>5s.</i></p>

<blockquote><p><i>Athenæum.</i>&mdash;"In the creation of the 'atmosphere' of the play M.
Maeterlinck shows his skill. It is here that he communicates to us
the <i>nouveau frisson</i>, here that he does what no one else has done.
In 'The Intruder' the art consists of the subtle gradations of
terror, the slow, creeping progress of the nightmare of
apprehension. Nothing quite like it has been done before&mdash;not even
by Poe&mdash;not even by Villiers."</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p><i>Times.</i>&mdash;"The language in which this play is couched is a model of
brevity, decision, and pointedness.... Every line tells, and there

property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
